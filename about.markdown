## About EBT
I began the Engineering by Trade project motivated by the freedom that a career in software development provides. You don’t need a degree. You can start from scratch and pave your own path to a fruitful career. The aim of this page is to be a resource in helping others accomplish this, so they too can expand their knowledge and understanding of development and the industry surrounding it.

## About the Author
I work as a senior software engineer at one of the Big Tech firms.  In college I received a Bachelor’s degree in Political Science and Economics before getting a Masters in Business Analytics.

My first position in the tech industry was as an “operations analyst”, what roughly amounts to a catch-all term for those who utilize data and information to shape grass roots business decisions. This position gave me the room to take it in whatever way I desired, so myself and a few teammates pushed a technical charter. From there we learned, grew, and gained responsibilities until moving the team to an engineering function became the next logical step.

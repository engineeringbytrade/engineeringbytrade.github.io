## About Me
I work as a senior software engineer at a big tech firm, holding a Bachelor's in Political Science/Economics and a Masters in Business Analytics

## About EBT
I began the Engineering by Trade project motivated by the freedom that a career in software development provides. You donâ€™t need a degree. You can start from scratch and pave your own path to a fruitful career. The aim of this page is to be a resource in helping others accomplish this, so they too can expand their knowledge and understanding of development and the industry surrounding it.

## Contact
The quickest way to contact me is through email,  where I try to respond to all messages. I can also be reached on the Engineering by Trade Facebook Page.

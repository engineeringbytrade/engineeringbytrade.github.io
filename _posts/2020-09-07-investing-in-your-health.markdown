Invest in your health! It’s a term you hear quite often. Typically this is in the context of a gym membership or equipment to encourage an active lifestyle. It can mean prioritizing a healthy diet. It can mean getting enough high quality sleep and staying cognizant of mental health.

These are all extremely important, but one oft overlooked way to improve your health is to invest in ergonomics. If you’re a programmer, you’re likely spending over 8 hours per day at your desk in front of your computer. This means for a normal work week,  you’re spending ~24% of your life at your desk in your chair. Looking at it this way, it seems insane not to spend time on ergonomics considering it accounts for a quarter of your professional life. We’re going to go over some tips and suggestions in this article. First we’ll look at Posture and Positioning, then move onto my personal favorite, Ergonomic Equipment

## Posture and Positioning
There are many articles that go over this in much more detail, but the gist of it can be boiled down to the following principles:

### Back Straight, Shoulders Back
This is essential, all ergonomics starts here. For those new to this, it might take awhile to be comfortable in this position. Your body will be using new stabilizing muscles, and this will take time to build. However, once the acclimation period has concluded, you’ll find this to be a comfortable posture that leaves your body feeling well after a long day in the chair. With this position in mind, we can then look at the final two ergonomic principles.

### The 90 Degree Principle
With your feet flat on the floor and your arms in the typing position, ensure both knee and elbow joints are at 90 degrees. Some chair/desk adjustment might be required to dial this in. Following the 90 degree principle ensures that your knees are level with the hips, and the hands are at (or slightly below) elbow level.

### The 1/3 Principle
If you only use only a laptop with no external keyboard, mouse, or monitor, then ignore this as you are confined to the geometry of this one unit. However, if you do have the luxury of making adjustments, try to get your monitor in a position such that when you stare straight ahead, your gaze falls in the top third of the monitor. In doing so, you’re keeping your head “on top of your shoulders”, letting your body support it as natural as possible, rather than working the much weaker neck muscles in harmful ways.

These are elements I would consider essential to a strong ergonomics foundation. From there, feel free to tinker. Maybe you want a balance board, standing desk, or peripherals (keyboard, mice) that further improve the strong base you’ve built. In the next section, I’ll go over a few of my favorite pieces of equipment for improved ergonomic health

## Ergonomic Equipment
### Keyboard
Put your hands on the home row of a flat traditional keyboard and take some time to observe your hands. Focus your attention on feeling out the position. Chances are, you’ll notice some tension in your wrists. Another thing you may have noticed is that your hands are close together, meaning your shoulders have to hunch inwards. This already is harming our ability to get into the aforementioned ideal desk position. By unnaturally demanding your hands rotate inward to the palms down position, as well as bringing your shoulders inward, it’s no wonder that traditional keyboards are often a ticking time bomb for wrist pain and long term health issues.

Luckily, companies have invested quite a bit in developing natural keyboards. Below are a few options I’ve used in the past and been pleased with:

#### [Microsoft Sculpt](https://amzn.to/2X967XA)

The Sculpt elevates in the middle to form an arch, which is exactly what you’re looking for in order to get your wrists in a more natural position. Your palms can rest about 15 degrees upwards from that of a traditional keyboard, which not only feels natural but greatly reduces the long term wear and tear

#### [Kinesis Freestyle](https://amzn.to/2XzwXXX)

While pricey, this is my favorite keyboard and the one I do most of my work on. It not only supports tenting (with a compatible kit) to improve the elevated degree for your palms, but also has independent left and right sides, meaning you can widen your typing position, which allows the shoulders to retreat to a more natural position. Combining these two elements allows for what is essentially the optimal typing position for your wrists, shoulders, and back. And for bonus points, it’s mechanical, meaning there are actual mechanical keys as opposed to a more mainstream “membrane” key used today. This gives increased tactile feedback in typing. It also comes in a gaming variant to add some more features.

### Mouse
The same principles of ergonomic keyboards apply to the mouse. The traditional design has your palm down, so what you want to be looking for is one that will angle your palm up a little more for a natural, comfortable feel. There are generally two options:

Ball – a bit better on the wrists than a vertical mouse, uses a ball to operate the cursor
Vertical – More precise than the ball. It works much like a regular mouse, just tilted 90 degrees to put your hand in a “handshake position”
Both are good options, and it ultimately comes down to personal preference. If you’ve never used either I’d recommend trying some out. Nonetheless, I’ll suggest some of my favorites

#### [Evoluent Vertical Mouse](https://amzn.to/36CNFtB)

This is my primary mouse and it’s a workhorse. The position is extremely comfortable and the mouse is plug and play.

#### [Anker Vertical Mouse](https://amzn.to/2XE6t7t)

This is a good budget friendly option to the Evoluent. While not as comfortable, it is effective in getting your wrist in proper positioning. It also comes in a wireless variant.

#### [Logitech Track Ball](https://amzn.to/3cavVGW)

It might look like an alien ship, but these are extremely comfortable to use. I tried one briefly and definitely enjoyed the comfort. I felt a lack of precision as the learning curve to use was a bit higher, but with a week or so of use I imagine someone could become extremely efficient with this mouse.

### Chair

#### [Herman Miller Aeron](https://amzn.to/2ZGq5e0)

Go to any Silicon Valley office and I can almost guarantee you’ll see a sea of these. And for good reason – the Herman Miller Aeron is unanimously . It’s also a pretty safe bet. Many people love it, and while some people prefer other chairs, no one I’ve met has ever flat out disliked one. This is somewhat expected given the price range. It’s an expensive chair, but check Facebook Marketplace or your local used office supply retailer. These chairs are common enough in the tech world that you’ll often be able to find a slightly used one for under half the MSRP.

#### [Steelcase Leap](https://amzn.to/2ZPzKPg)

Another popular alternative. If you don’t like mesh seating and backing, the Leap has full foam support, using their LiveBack technology to mimic and mold to the spine.

### Accessories
Outside of the main categories, there are a few things you can do like monitor stands and laptop risers to elevate your view. You may also consider some gel supports for your mouse or keyboard. These are all cost-effective ways of improving your health, and in the long term drastically improving your productivity behind the desk.

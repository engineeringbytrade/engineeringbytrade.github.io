In the upcoming weeks/months/years, I’ll be writing a series of articles on interview preparation, focusing on specific topics like the different types of interviews you’ll see, how to prepare, and how skills learned here translate into a successful career. But before that, I wanted to kick off this series with a general post on what kind of mindset you need to go from no CS background or education to hired engineer at a Big Tech firm.

When starting I didn’t know what Big-O meant, stack/heap, memory allocation, etc. I had taken a basic intro to Python course on Codeacademy, but that was practically it. However, through structured learning and dedication, I was able to successfully obtain a FAANG Software Engineering job. The method in doing so can essentially be distilled into three main steps: Commitment, Planning, and Execution

## Commitment

To go from zero to hired engineer, expect to invest 8 or more hours a day for several months. If you have a full time job and can only put forth a few hours per day, that works but expect for the timeline to extend longer. Make an effort to Always Be Coding, and think through how you can carve out time in your daily schedule to start down a path towards learning software development.

## Planning

The field of computer science is immensely broad – you could spend lifetimes learning the different facets. Therefore, it is essential that you approach learning with thought and strategy. Making sure you’re specific on what you’re learning is often the most important step of the process, and unfortunately where most people go astray.

At a high level, here are the elements you’ll want to focus on:

Become an expert in one general purpose language – In coding interviews, you are typically not constrained to using a specific language and can use whatever you prefer. Pick a widely used language that you can focus your efforts on, and learn the quirks of the language. Good examples would be C++, Java, Python, or possibly Javascript if you know you want to focus on front end development
Learn the CS Fundamentals – Having a good understanding of data structures and algorithms is key. You should also learn about algorithmic complexity/Big-O/Asymptotic analysis so that you can gauge the performance of your coded solutions. From there, continue to branch out into further niches like memory allocation, garbage collection, recursion, bitwise operations, and so on.
Understand System Designs – Learn and understand how apps and small systems get built. Learning how the client (e.g. mobile device) communicates to the server and databases via APIs is key to your ability to scope a project, a key signal for technical interviews. Learn about CDNs, load balancers, etc. Think through different data models and how the data used should be best represented

With a plan in place you’re now ready to execute. Make sure to segment your time across the three focus areas, and put them to use – that is, read the books, watch the videos, and practice problems at the same time. There are many practice problem websites like Leet Code, Hacker Rank, etc. which can serve as a good start, with the go to resource being Crack the Coding Interview (solutions in Java).

## Execution

Treat this like you would study anything else. Take notes, build cheat sheets, make flash cards, and explore other techniques to help you retain information.

Focus on writing questions on a whiteboard or paper, not a computer. Interviews are often on whiteboards, so get used to writing it out from scratch, then rewriting on a computer and testing.

## Conclusion

As you can see, preparing for an interview is a lot of work. But the skills grown and topics learned here also directly benefit your ability to program effectively, and will stay with you for decades to come. There is a lot of information, so prioritizing effectively is going to be key to making sure you stay down the right path and ramp up on your new career. With dedicated time learning and practicing, following this general outline should put you on the right path towards successfully getting that next big job. Happy coding!
